- Control Flow:
  - if-else, 
  - for loops,
  - while loops (break & continue),
  - nested loops  
- Pattern Printing  
- Functions & Recursion  
- Time Complexity (basics)  
- Data Structures:
  - Lists (1D, 2D, list of strings, operations)
  - Stack & Queue (using lists)
  - Sets
  - Dictionaries
  - Tuples
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Classes & Objects
  - Constructors
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
